# PacMan Final Project

This is a (very) simplifies version of the old PacMan game, submitted as the capstone project of my c++ course.

### Building instructions

To build the project:
1. Either create a new build directory, or use the directory 'build' already set-up in the workspace.
2. cd to the build directory.
3 cmake .. and then (after configuration is complete) 'make'.
   

The program should compile error-free.
   
### Running the game 

Start the game from within the build directory by ./PacManFP, and the switch to the desktop.
